# Raycasting
This Unity Project is my Kitchen Sink of **Raycasting** for when I want to practice Unity Raycasting techniques.

# Screen point to ray
The main raycast being used is making a ray that starts at the camera and goes through the point the user clicks on the screen.

# Nav To Point
The player can click using the screen point to ray for input and a navAgent will bring the player to that point.

# Hit Object Position and Normals
An indicator (cylinder) appears at the location where the screen ray is pointed.  The rotation of the indicator is dependent on the normal of the surface at the hit location.

# Deflection
There is a floating sphere that aims at the player and emits a beam that deflects off of the player.
